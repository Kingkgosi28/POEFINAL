This is the Final part of my POE. It has been challenging but through dedication i have managed to fix all my errors from part 1 and part2 

The changes which I made based on my feedback for part 2 was that my code didn't return the recipes which were intially inserted in the machine and did not prompt a message declaring to user's that their calory amount has exceed the needed amount of calories.

If you want to run the program you have to download the source file, then locate where you have downloaded it on your deskotop or laptop. After that you look for the PROG6221_POE.sln which contains the solution code of the program.

Then you compile the code and press the run button which will then run the whole program
